# TemplateForGames

These files together are the basis for many HTML 5 canvas games I have made with Javascript.
Reading the comments in the template.js should be enough to get you started.
If you have additional questions find me on twitter @ColeDitzlerOnTw.
You can tweet at me, or DM me directly.
